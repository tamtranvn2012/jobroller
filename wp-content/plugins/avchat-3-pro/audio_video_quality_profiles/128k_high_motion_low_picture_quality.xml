			The snd tag controls the quality/bandwidth of audio. 
			Higher quality sound will use more bandwidth.
			Flash Player supports encoding sount in 2 codecs: NellyMoser and Speex.
			Speex is newer,better and open source, that's why its used by default.
			Speex has been introduced in Flash Player 10.
			Possible values:
				44 : NellyMoser, highest quality
				22 : NellyMoser, medium high quality
				11 : NellyMoser, medium low quality
				8 : NellyMoser, low quality
				5 : NellyMoser, lowest quality
				speex10 : Speex, highest quality, uses 42.2kbits/s of bandwidth
				speex9 : 34.2kbits/s
				speex8 : 27.8kbits/s
				speex7 : 23.8kbits/s
				speex6 : Speex, default value, uses 20.6kbits/s of bandwidth
				speex5 : 16.8kbits/s
				speex4 : 12.8kbits/s
				speex3 : Speex, low quality, lowest usable quality,  uses 9.80kbits/s
				speex2 : 7.75kbits/s
				speex1 : 5.75kbits/s
				speex0 : Speex, lowest quality, not really usable,  uses 3.95kbits/s

		Flash Player 6  (released in 2002) and above supports encoding video with the Sorenson Spark codec.
		Flash Player 11 (released in October 2011) and above supports encoding video with the H.264 codec. 
		
		The vcodec tag in this XML file controls which of the supported video codecs is used to encode the video.
		Posible values:
			h264 	 : use this value to encode video with H.264 codec (Main Profile with Level 3_1 are  used, for more details check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC#Profiles)
			sorenson : use this value to encode video using the Sorenson Spark video codec
